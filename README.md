# Conference website

<h2 id="about">🪧 About</h2>

The Conference Website project emerges as a response to the necessity for a straightforward and customizable solution in crafting conference websites. Envisioned as an open-source platform, this initiative strives to deliver an accessible template for building and personalizing conference websites, circumventing the complexities of intricate development environments.

To address this issue, we've developed the Conference Website project based on the Next.js framework. We've embraced simplicity by using plain JSON files to store the data needed for the conference website. This data-driven approach allows event organizers to effortlessly update conference details, schedules, speakers, and more without delving into complex coding or database management.
